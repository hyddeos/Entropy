    <p class="my-1">This is calculated with the formula</p>
    <img src="public/images/formula.svg" alt="img of the formula">
    <p class="my-1">That's the number of possible ways to rearrange the particles without
        changing the overall state(ie maintaining the same number of particles in the boxes).
    </p>
    <p class="my-1"><strong class="bold">For example:</strong> There is only one way all particles can be in one box, as soon as one particle is in another box the state is not the same.
        But if you have one particle in each box. The particles can swap places with each other
        and there overall state will still be the same, there for in that case there are 2 possible
        configurations.
